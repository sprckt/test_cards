# Welcome to Cards

This is a demo application being built in conjunction with the [Test & Code podcast](http://testandcode.com).

We'll be building up this application, and testing it, and adding functionality, while discussing software testing and development practices.

Follow along, starting with [episode 37](http://testandcode.com/37).

There will be more documentation here at some point. :)
